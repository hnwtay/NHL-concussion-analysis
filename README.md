# NHL Concussion Analysis

## Introduction
Concussions are a significant concern in professional sports, including the National Hockey League (NHL). This project analyzes NHL concussion data spanning from the 2012/13 to the 2022/23 seasons to understand the frequency, impact, and risk associated with concussions in professional ice hockey.

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephmclauchlan/nhl-concussion-data-2012-2023) and covers various aspects, including teams involved, player positions, games missed due to concussions, and financial implications for both players and teams.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis includes the following components:

### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning
   - Obtaining and preparing the NHL concussion dataset for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
   - Exploring the basic statistics and characteristics of the dataset.
   
### 3. Data Analysis
   #### Frequency Distributions
   - Analyzing the frequency distributions of concussions over time.
   
   #### Trend Analysis
   - Identifying trends in concussion rates over multiple NHL seasons.
   
   #### Comparative Analysis
   - Comparing concussion rates by team and player position.
   
   #### Impact and Risk Analysis
   - Assessing the financial impact of concussions on teams and players.
   - Identifying high-risk players, teams, and positions based on historical data.
   
### 4. Conclusions
   - Summarizing the key findings and implications of the analysis.
